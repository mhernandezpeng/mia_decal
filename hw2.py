# 1) Suppose your current working directory is ~/Desktop/classes/python_decal/. What command would allow you to navigate directly to ~/Desktop?
# cd ../../

# 2) What does ~/ mean?
# It means you are in the default/home directory. 

# 3) What's the difference between and abolute and a relative path in your terminal?
# Absolute path is the path to a file/directory regardless of where you currently are, and 
# a relative path depends on where you are (path relative to where you're trying to go)

# 4) What command would bring you back to your home directory?
# cd 

# 5) If you called rm ./ in your current working directory, what would it do? 
# It would delete everything in your current directory.

# 6) In your current working directory, what does calling "git add" do? What about "git commit"? What about "git push"?
# git add adds specified files to the "staging area", where they can be committed (saved) and pushed to your repository
# with git commit and git push.

# 7) Let's say you call "git add" in your current working directory and then "git status". What message would appear? What is it telling you?
# It would display the files that have been added but not commited yet.

# 8) What has been the most frustrating error or bug you've encountered in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot and resolve it?
# I initially had some trouble with git push not working, but I went to office hours and was able to get the issue resolved.

# 9) How does cloning a repository differ from pulling from a repository?
# Cloning a repository makes you a copy of the entire repository, while pulling is just like updating your local branch. 

# 10) Tell me a fun fact!
# My dog's birthday is this weekend :D
